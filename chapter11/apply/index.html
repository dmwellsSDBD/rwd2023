			<p>It is important to prepare for a job interview. First, make sure that you have completely read the job description. Write down any questions about the position so that you can ask them during the interview. Thoroughly research the company. Know when the business started, the name of the CEO or company president, and what products and services are offered.</p>
			
			<p>Know what you are going to wear to the interview. Dress your best. Make sure that your clothes are not wrinkled. Make sure that you are well-groomed and look presentable.
