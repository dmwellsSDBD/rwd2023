            <h3>Modifying Images</h3>
            
            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
            <p>Use of descriptive file names helps improve search engine optimization.</p>
            
            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>I used Paint to change the size of the image.</p>
            
            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>The original size of the image was 2121 x 1414 pixels.</p>
            
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height="333" width="500">
            
            <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? Use complete sentences.  -->
            <p>I used compressor.io to compress the image file. The original image file size was 29.22 KB. After the image file was compressed, the file size reduced to 11.46 KB.</p>
            
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5-min.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height="333" width="500">
            
            <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
            <p>In comparing these two images, the change I notice is the color of the blue background. In the original file, the blue seems brighter than that compressed file. The original file seems brighter than the compressed file.</p>

                <!-- 6th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to provide information about the resource you used to help create your SVG image -->
                <p>I used W3Schools.com as a resource to create the SVG graphic above.</p>
